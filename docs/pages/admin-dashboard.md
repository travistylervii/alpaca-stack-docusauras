# Admin Dashboard

The Admin Dashboard is a restricted area for staff and company administrators to manage site content and structure. It offers a centralized interface for updating blog posts, adding media, and performing other tasks to ensure the site remains dynamic and up-to-date, enhancing productivity and control.

## Posts
The post section in the admin dashboard allows administrators to add, edit, and delete posts for the front end of the site. Admins can create new posts with a rich text editor, manage existing content by updating titles and body text, and delete outdated or irrelevant posts.
