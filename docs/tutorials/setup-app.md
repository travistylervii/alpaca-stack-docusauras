## Written Tutorial
### 1. Get Access to the Repository

After purchasing Alpaca Stack, you will gain access to an invite form on the dashboard page ([Alpaca Stack Dashboard](https://alpacastack.com/dashboard)).

To gain access to the repository:

1. Enter your GitHub username in the provided form.
2. Submit the form.

You will receive an email from GitHub with an invitation. If you don't see the email in your inbox, check your spam folder. Accept the invitation to gain access to the repository.

### 2. Download Files

Once you have access to the private repository:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate (cd) to the directory where you want to store the files on your local machine.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command: git clone [repo]

### 3. Install Dependencies

To install the necessary dependencies:

1. Navigate to the Alpaca Stack directory in your terminal.
2. Install the NPM modules by running: npm install

Allow the installer to download all the required NPM modules.

### 4. Setup ENV File

To set up your environment variables:

1. Copy the env.example file and rename it to .env.
2. Most of the environment variables cannot be changed at this moment. This tutorial will guide you through setting up the services and sites in the .env file, filling in the keys and values with your personal information.
