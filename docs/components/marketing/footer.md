# Footer

The Footer Section serves as the concluding element of our website, providing essential information and links that users might need. This section typically includes navigation links, contact details, social media icons, legal information, and other important resources. By organizing this information in a clear and accessible manner, the Footer Section enhances the overall user experience and ensures that visitors can easily find what they need even at the bottom of the page.

## Changing the navigation
The routes are handled in the /constants/nav-routes.ts file. Here, you will find all the navigation routes for various menus, including the header menu, footer menu, dashboard menu, admin menu, and sidebar menus.
