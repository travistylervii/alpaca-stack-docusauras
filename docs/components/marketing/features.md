  - Example: A smartphone with a 12-megapixel camera, 128GB storage, and a fingerprint scanner. 
- A benefit: A benefit explains how that feature positively impacts the user, focusing on the value it provides.
  - Example: The 128GB storage means you can store more photos, videos, and apps without worrying about running out of space.

Essentially, features describe the product, while benefits highlight why it matters to the user.
